## Some Important Literature

@lupianez_disruptions_2015 is a great article discussing the consequences of disrupting the 3d structure of topologically associating domains shown through genome editing.

@rube_prediction_2022 is relevant to my research into machine learning models which can accurately recover biophysical parameters from sequencing data resulting from protein ligand interactions.

## A cool equation or two

$e^{i\pi}-1=0$

$\int_0^{x}f(t)dt=F(x)-F(0)$
